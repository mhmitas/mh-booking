## 1. Welcome to Greenhaven Community Conservation Group
Since its founding in 2010 by a coalition of local educators and residents, GCCG has been a cornerstone of environmental stewardship in Greenhaven’s 50-square-mile region. Our ecosystems—rivers, forests, and wetlands—support local recreation, reduce flooding for 5,000 residents, and sequester 18,000 tons of CO2 annually. Facing challenges like pollution and urban growth, we empower volunteers to restore habitats, educate thousands through workshops and school programs, and foster community pride through events like Green Drinks. Our core values—education, inclusivity, and collaboration—drive our mission to create a sustainable Greenhaven for all.  
**Why Greenhaven Matters**: Our rivers provide clean water for 10,000 residents, our forests offer trails for 5,000 annual visitors, and our wetlands mitigate $2 million in flood damage yearly.  
**Why Volunteer with GCCG?**  
- **Educate and Inspire**: Teach sustainability to students or learn restoration techniques.  
- **Build Community**: Connect with neighbors at festivals and cleanups.  
- **Make an Impact**: Restore ecosystems and shape local policies.  
- **Flexible Fun**: Volunteer once or regularly—every moment counts!
